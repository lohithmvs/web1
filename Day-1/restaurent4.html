Another among the newly opened restaurants in Hyderabad, Flechazo’s serves Asian, North Indian and 
Mediterranean dishes. The décor, ambience and hospitality are definitely worth experiencing, and these never 
fail to leave an impression. Free Wi-Fi and valet parking are the cherry on top. The sandy brown tables and 
leather sofas with light blue upholstery do just enough to bring the Mediterranean to the restaurant..
