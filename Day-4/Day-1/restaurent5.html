AB’s Absolute Barbecues is one of the best buffet restaurants in Hyderabad that serves the ever enticing ‘Wish 
Grill’. It is a jam-packed foodie hotspot, so prior reservations are usually a good idea. With a casual ambience 
and quick service, it makes for a memorable meal with family and friends. Another plus point is that there are 
not one but two outlets within the city that are equally good. In terms of cuisine, the restaurant serves European, 
Mediterranean as well as North Indian. The best thing about it is that nobody is going to disturb you in your quest to gorge on all you can!
