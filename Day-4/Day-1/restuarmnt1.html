Almond House | Among the Best Veg Restaurants in Hyderabad


If you are looking to satiate your sweet tooth, then 
Almond House is the right place for you. Other than lip-smacking sweets, 
it also serves savoury chaats. Plus, it also checks the box of being economical. 
You can buy the sweets individually or as part of gift packs. Its highlight 
is perhaps its separate selection of desserts made with dry fruits like cashews, 
raisins, pistachios and, of course, almonds.
