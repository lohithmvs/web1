As per the 8th century BCE Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana, the Andhras left North India off the banks
of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India. In the third century BCE, Andhra was a vassal kingdom 
of Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire. After his death, it became powerful and extended its empire to the whole 
Maratha country and beyond under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty. After that, the major rulers included 
the <i>Pallavas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahi dynasty, Nizam dynasty, East 
India Company, and British Raj</i>.

The Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line separating coastal plains and peneplains. The coastal plains 
are part of Coastal Andhra. These are mostly delta regions formed by the Krishna, Godavari, and Penna 
rivers. Peneplains are part of Rayalaseema. 60% of the population is engaged in agriculture and related 
activities. <mark>Rice is the state's major food crop and staple food. The state contributes 10% of total fish 
production and over 70% of shrimp production in India. Industry sectors such as food products, non-metallic 
minerals, textiles, and pharmaceuticals are the top employment providers. The automotive sector accounts for 
10% of India's auto exports</mark>. The state has about one-third of India's limestone reserves, large deposits of 
baryte and galaxy granite, and <del>reserves</del> of oil and natural gas.[11] Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), known
