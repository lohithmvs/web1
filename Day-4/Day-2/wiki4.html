Mexicans

<p>
<b>Mexicans</b> (Spanish: <strong>Mexicanos</strong>) are the citizens and nationals of the <a href="https://google.com">United Mexican States</a>.

The most spoken language by Mexicans is <a href="https://google.com">Spanish</a>, but many also speak languages from 68 different 
Indigenous linguistic groups and other languages brought to Mexico by recent immigration or learned 
by Mexican expatriates residing in other countries. <i>In 2015, 21.5% of Mexico's population self-identified 
as being <a href="https://google.com">Indigenous</a></i>. There are about 12 million Mexican nationals residing outside Mexico, 
with about 11.7 million[50] living in the United States. The larger Mexican diaspora can also include 
individuals that trace ancestry to Mexico and self-identify as Mexican yet are not necessarily Mexican 
by citizenship. The <del>United States</del> has the largest Mexican population in the world after Mexico at 37,186,361 (2019).

<mark>The modern nation of Mexico achieved independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821</mark>, after a decade-long war 
for independence starting in 1810; this began the process of forging a national identity that fused the 
cultural traits of Indigenous pre-Columbian origin with those of Spanish ancestry. This led to what has 
been termed "a peculiar form of multi-ethnic nationalism".
