Vijayanagara Empire
</h1>
<p>
The <b>Vijayanagara Empire</b> (/vɪˌdʒəjəˈnɑːɡərə/; also called the <strong>Karnata Kingdom</strong>) was a medieval <a href="http://google.com">Hindu</a> empire 
that covered much of the region of <a href="http://google.com">Southern India</a>, ruling the lands of the modern states of <i>Karnataka, Andhra 
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa, and some parts of Telangana, Maharashtra and some parts of Sri Lanka</i>. It was 
established in 1336 by the brothers Harihara I and Bukka Raya I of the Sangama dynasty, members of a pastoralist 
cowherd community that claimed Yadava lineage.The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the 
southern powers to ward off Turco-Persian Muslim invasions by the end of the 13th century. At its peak, it 
conquered almost all of Southern India's ruling dynasties and pushed the Turco-Persian sultans of the Deccan beyond 
the Tungabhadra-Krishna River doab region, in addition to annexing Gajapati Empire (Odisha) up to the Krishna River, 
thus becoming a notable power.

The empire lasted until 1646, although its power greatly declined after <mark>a major military defeat in the Battle of 
Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates</mark>. The empire is named after its capital city of 
Vijayanagara, as Hampi was renamed, whose extensive ruins are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Karnataka. The 
wealth and fame of the empire inspired visits by and writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, 
Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò de' Conti. <eni>These travelogues, contemporary literature and epigraphy in the local languages, 
and modern archeological excavations at Vijayanagara have provided ample information about the history and power of the empire<eni>.

The empire's legacy includes monuments spread over Southern India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. 
Different temple building traditions in South and Central India were merged into the Vijayanagara architecture style. 
This synthesis inspired architectural innovations in the construction of Hindu temples. Efficient administration and 
vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies to the region such as water management systems for irrigation.
